# ExpenseTracker
Application for taking notes of your daily expenses and monitoring your budget for remaining days in the month! This application is made as simple as it could be since it took merely 1 day from the design to the deployment (debugging excluded)!

## Features
* Simplest design to memo your expense as fast as possible: write down the number and add it! (Only one tab to change the category of expenses and you can also add any descriptions if needed)
* Add the monthly expenses like housing, electricity, gym membership, etc. You can decide to repeat each of monthly expenses automatically once the new month arrives as well.
* Review your expenses in current or previous months. Keep track of your remaining budget.
